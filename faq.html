                                <p>Unlike traditional filters that physically trap contaminants, LARQ’s UV-C technology neutralizes harmful microorganisms at the DNA level, ensuring water is free from bacteria, viruses, and mold without altering taste. While filters require frequent cartridge replacements and can’t prevent bottle contamination, our system actively cleans both water and the bottle’s interior every 2 hours. Independent lab tests confirm a 99.99% reduction of pathogens like E. coli and SARS-CoV-2. Plus, UV-C leaves no chemical residue, making it ideal for travelers and outdoor enthusiasts.</p>

                                <p>The LARQ bottle itself is not dishwasher safe, as the UV-C light cap contains delicate electronics. To ensure longevity, we recommend hand-washing the bottle with mild soap and warm water. However, the bottle's design is simple and easy to clean, and the bottle's self-cleaning feature ensures that it stays free from bacteria and odors. Just activate the self-cleaning feature regularly, and the bottle remains hygienic without requiring deep cleaning.</p>

The light cycle is fast and efficient, meaning you can drink purified water almost immediately. Once the self-cleaning cycle is completed, the bottle automatically powers off. This means you don't have to worry about keeping track of the timer.</p>

                                <p>UV-C light is a powerful ultraviolet radiation that kills bacteria, viruses, and other harmful microorganisms by disrupting their DNA. LARQ uses a specific wavelength of UV-C light (around 260 to 280 nanometers) that is particularly effective in sterilizing water. The self-cleaning mechanism in the LARQ bottle utilizes this UV-C light to purify the water inside, ensuring that it is free from contaminants that may cause illness or unpleasant odors.</p>

                                <p>Absolutely. The UV-C light is fully contained within the bottle’s stainless steel interior, with zero exposure during operation. It’s designed to automatically shut off when opened, ensuring safety. Unlike UV-C wands or open lamps, LARQ poses no risk to skin or eyes. However, never look directly at the activated LED if disassembling the device.</p>
