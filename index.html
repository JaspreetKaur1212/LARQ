            <p class="lead">
                At LARQ, we believe hydration is more than just a necessity. It’s an integral part of living a healthy, balanced lifestyle. Proper hydration has far-reaching benefits, not only for physical health but also for mental clarity and overall well-being.

Our mission is simple: to make hydration easy, accessible, and sustainable for everyone.
